# Specification Quality Checklist: Lecture 5 — OOP in Python and Working with Files

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Spec covers all 12 constitution-mandated topics for Lecture 5 plus 5 educator-suggested enhancements
- Mini-project (Contact Book with JSON persistence) is fully specified with both in-class and homework extension scope
- File I/O section is explicitly scoped to be independently runnable from OOP sections
- All constitution quality standards (Ukrainian language, meme count, exercise count, runnable code minimum) are captured as FRs
- Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan`
