# Contracts: Lecture 3 — Data Structures + Pythonic Patterns + Functions

## Not Applicable

This feature is **educational content** (a Jupyter notebook lecture), not a software application.

API contracts, OpenAPI specs, and similar technical specifications are not applicable for educational content development.

## What This Feature Produces

Instead of API contracts, this feature produces:

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `lecture-03.ipynb` | Jupyter notebook with lecture content |
| `assets/diagrams/` | Memory layout diagrams (list, tuple, dict internals) |
| `assets/memes/` | Educational humor elements |

## Validation

Lecture quality is validated against:
- Constitution requirements (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`)
- Specification acceptance criteria (`spec.md`)
- Quality checklist (`checklists/requirements.md`)
