# Specification Quality Checklist: Lecture 4 — Functions (continue) + Modules + Errors + Intro to OOP

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass. The spec references "Jupyter Notebook" and "Python 3.11+" in functional requirements, which is acceptable because these are the delivery format and runtime constraint (not implementation choices — the course is inherently a Python course delivered via Jupyter).
- The spec correctly defers advanced OOP topics to Lecture 5 and limits decorator coverage to introductory level.
- Visual requirements are clear: minimum 2 internet-sourced visuals per sub-topic with attribution.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers are present — all decisions were resolved with reasonable defaults documented in the Assumptions section.
